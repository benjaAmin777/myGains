# My Gains

This is a personal project made to keep a record of my lifting training. 
This project is made in laravel 12 using Livewire 3.6.3

## 📋 Features

- Keep a record of my PR  
- Keep a record of my latest lift weights  
- Show graphics about my progress  
- Send me reminders to note the data of my training  
- Keep a streak (for newbies)

For now, these will be the main features of the project, but I hope I can add more in the future.

## 🚀 Get started
